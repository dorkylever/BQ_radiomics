# BQ_radiomics
radiomics standalone for I-cube Lab. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.7
* Visual Studio Tools 2017

## Installation
A Pypi repoistory has been created for initial installation:

`pip install Icube-radiomics`

This should work but if not, you try to create and install via the use of a conda environment. My reccomendation would be using the Anaconda and Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html

## Usage
